This directory contains placeholder sound files for the 2D Shooter MVP.

Sound files that should be placed here:
- shoot.wav - Player shooting sound
- hit.wav - Bullet hitting enemy sound
- death.wav - Enemy death sound
- spawn.wav - Enemy spawn sound
- pickup.wav - Item pickup sound
- hurt.wav - Player taking damage sound
- game_over.wav - Game over sound

These files are optional - the game will run without them and fail silently if they're missing.
